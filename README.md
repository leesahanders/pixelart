## News

- August 1, 2018: add Shiny app for resizing images.

- March 10, 2018: run kmeans in the Lab space (instead of the RGB space)

- Nov 18, 2017: added some options for croping, rotating and saturating the image

## To improve

I think there is room for improving the pixel art models (e.g. better separation of colors). Maybe with [package imager](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/vignettes/pixsets.html). Ideas are welcome.
